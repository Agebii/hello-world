# hello-world
Hello Github!

Heyho, my name is Agebii. Right now I am a 23 year old Computer-Science student at the RWTH-Aachen in Germany.
I'm really interested in Maschine Learning and Web Development. 

Right now I'm really starting to get my hands on programming. The last year there wasn't much time for that, because our university is strongly theoretical and mathematical. I hope I will contribute a lot of good work in the future. 

See you!
